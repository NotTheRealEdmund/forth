# forth
To try out Forth, download SwiftForth free evaluation version<br/>
Run SwiftForth IDE in C:\ForthInc-Evaluation\SwiftForth\bin\sf.exe<br/>
It is recommended to create shortcut or pin it to taskbar for convenience for future use<br/>
Aside from using it to run code, you can also include files to run user-created definitions<br/>
For example, you can include C:\ForthInc-Evaluation\SwiftForth\lib\samples\win32\helloworld.f and you can run that application from the current file.<br/>
Forth files end with .f
